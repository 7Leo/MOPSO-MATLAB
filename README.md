# MOPSO-MATLAB
Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with MATLAB Language Programming
This is a metaheuristic algorithm for optimizing multi objective problems.

## How to Run
1. Change `cost_function.m` file according your objective functions.
2. Change pso parameter in `main.m` file
3. Modify `PlotCosts.m` for generating plots
4. Run `main.m`
